Fping is a simple ping program, intended to be used instead of the
standard ping program that comes with windows. It was first made
to ping faster than once every second. Options have been added since
then and fping is now a very handy tool (at least I think it is).

PLATFORMS:
Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, 2000, ME, XP, 2003 server, Vista, 7 and 2008 server

Ping is one of the most useful network debugging tools available. The first ping 
program was written by Mike Muuss in December 1983 for use on Unix machines. Muuss 
named his program after the sonar sounds used for echolocation by submarines, 
although some say ping stands for "Packet InterNet Grouper". Ping sends a small 
packet of information containing an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to a specified computer, 
which then sends an ECHO_REPLY packet in return. The ping program then evaluates 
this reply, and a report is shown. You can check several things with the ping 
program: can you reach another computer, how long does it take to bounce a packet 
off of another site, ... You can ping either a domain name, or an IP address. 
Functionality to show domain names when using IP addresses is supported. Even 
routing options are available, alas only 9 routes can be shown due to the 
structure of the IP header (RFC 792). Why did I write my own ping program? 
There are two main reasons: a) It wanted to know how the ping program worked. I 
found it really intriguing and was very curious and b) There was a need for a 
better ping program here at the lab where I work.

Usage:
fping <host(-list)> [-t time] [-w timeout] [-c] [-n count] [-s data_size]
       [-S size1/size2] [-R min/max] [-d ping_data] [-h TTL] [-v TOS]
       [-r routes] [-f] [-j] [-g host1/host2] [-H filename] [-a] [-A]
       [-p(x)] [-i] [-b(-)] [-T] [-D] [-l] [-o] [-L filename]

Options:
        -t : time between 2 pings in ms up to 1000000
        -w : timeout in ms to wait for each reply
        -c : continuous ping (higher priority than -n)
             to see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
             to stop - type Control-C.
        -n : number of pings to send to each host
        -s : amount of data in bytes up to 65500
        -S : size sweep: ping with size1, size1 + 1, ..., size2 bytes
        -R : random length between min and max (disabled when using -S)
        -d : ping with specified data
        -h : number of hops (TTL: 1 to 128) + print hops
        -v : Type Of Service (0 to 255) (IPv4-only)
        -r : record route (1 to 9 routes) (IPv4-only)
        -f : set Don't Fragment flag in packet (IPv4-only)
        -j : print jitter with each reply (only when pinging one host)
        -g : ping IP range from host1 to host2 (IPv4-only)
        -H : get hosts from filename (comma delimited, filename with full path)
        -a : resolve addresses to hostnames
	-A : print addresses with each reply
        -p : use a thread pool to ping multiple hosts (enables ICMP dll)
             x is optional and allows you to choose the number of threads
             e.g. -p uses a thread for every host
                  -p5 uses a pool of 5 threads/core
        -i : use ICMP dll instead of raw socket (disables -r)
        -b : beep on every successful reply (-b- to beep on timeout)
        -T : print timestamp with each reply
        -D : print datestamp with each reply
        -l : limit the output to ping results and errors
        -o : limit the output to ping statistics
        -L : logging to a text file

fping uses raw sockets. This can be a problem for NT / 2000 / XP system
users without administrator rights. Raw socket creation will fail
due to a silly and useless socket protection. Fping will switch
to the ICMP dll if this happens (to ping the micro$oft way). To 
disable this protection (and take full advantage of fping) you can
do the following:
a) NT4 users should change / add the following registry variable
and set its value to DWORD 1:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Afd\Parameters\DisableRawSecurity
b) 2000 / XP users should set the following registry variable to DWORD 1
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\AllowUserRawAccess

Also, if you want to change the TOS on 2000/XP systems, you need to add the
following value in the registry and set it to 0:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPip\Parameters\DisableUserTOSSetting

after you change the registry, you will need to reboot.
You can also run the reg file in accordance with your os.

Return Values:
Reply: 0
Reply timed out: 1
Host not found: 2
Packet size exceeds MTU: 3
Too few bytes: 4
Non-echo type: 5
